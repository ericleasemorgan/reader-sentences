See you now; Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth: And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, With windlasses and with assays of bias, By indirections find directions out:
go to; have you wisdom?
Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.
REGAN Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.
If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice; Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend, All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder; Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire:
As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd, Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.

When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!

Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;
PANDARUS I speak no more than truth.
CRESSIDA To say the truth, true and not true.

For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.
ARCHIDAMUS Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.
[Aside] To laughter, as I take it, If the good truth were known.
LEONTES There is no truth at all
what a fool Honesty is!
