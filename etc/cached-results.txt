We are not concerned to determine what is the residuum of truth which remains for ourselves.
May we not answer with absolute truth--A knowledge which will do us good?
'Quite true,' I replied.
'Very true.'
'Very true,' I said.
Mere consistency is no test of truth.
But how about truth, then?
I should say that every part is true.
There is a deal of truth in what you say. SOCRATES:
Nay, my friend, I am disposed to think that we have not reached the truth as yet.
Yet every word that I say is true.
True.
True.
True.
True.
True.
But if we speak the truth, clearly we must say what is.
Let thus much be said; and further let us affirm what seems to be the truth, that, whether one is or is not, one and the others in relation to themselves and one another, all of them, in every way, are and are not, and appear to be and appear not to be.
'True.'
'Very true.'
'Very true.'
Weary of asking 'What is truth?'
Whereas, the truth is that God is never in any way unrighteous--he is perfect righteousness; and he of us who is the most righteous is most like him.
If the Many were not, if all things were names of the One, and nothing could be predicated of any other thing, how could truth be distinguished from falsehood?
There was no distinction between truth and falsehood, between the Sophist and the philosopher.
Yet, as everybody knows, truth is not wholly the possession of either.
Can any one say or think that falsehood really exists, and avoid being caught in a contradiction?
The true says what is true about you?
'True.'
But still we want truth?
Which has the greater share of truth?
Also we said that truth was to form an element in the mixture.
