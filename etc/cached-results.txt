" And Minerva said," There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while Penelope has such a fine son as you are.
" Then Penelope 's heart sank within her, and for a long time she was speechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find no utterance.
" Then he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of grief.
Penelope washed her face, changed her dress, and went upstairs with her maids.
She told the vision to go to the house of Ulysses, and to make Penelope leave off crying, so it came into her room by the hole through which the thong went for pulling the door to, and hovered over her head saying, "You are asleep, Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not suffer you to weep and be so sad.
Not that your wife, Ulysses, is likely to murder you, for Penelope is a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature.
"As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go to the town unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news about Ulysses.
I should like also to go to the house of Ulysses and bring news of her husband to Queen Penelope.
There is also another matter; if you are indeed my son and my blood runs in your veins, let no one know that Ulysses is within the house— neither Laertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor any of the servants, nor even Penelope herself.
This servant and Eumaeus happened to meet when they were both on the same errand of going to tell Penelope.
Then Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors.
In the evening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses and his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were helping one another to get supper ready; Minerva therefore came up to Ulysses, turned him into an old man with a stroke of her wand, and clad him in his old clothes again, for fear that the swineherd might recognise him and not keep the secret, but go and tell Penelope.
Penelope came out of her room looking like Diana or Venus, and wept as she flung her arms about her son.
" With these words he moved the heart of Penelope.
Now when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the banquetingcloister, she said before her maids," Would that Apollo would so strike you, Antinous," and her waiting woman Eurynome answered," If our prayers were answered not one of the suitors would ever again see the sun rise."
" "Call him here, then," said Penelope," that I too may hear his story.
" "I will tell Penelope," answered Ulysses," nothing but what is strictly true.

" Eurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and as soon as Ulysses had sat down Penelope began by saying," Stranger, I shall first ask you who and whence are you?
" Then Penelope answered," Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty, whether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and my dear husband with them.
" Many a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope wept as she listened, for her heart was melted.
" Penelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable proofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again found relief in tears she said to him," Stranger, I was already disposed to pity you, but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome in my house.
" As she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to tell her that her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was unable to look in that direction and observe what was going on, for Minerva had diverted her attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat with his right hand and with his left drew her close to him, and said," Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at your own breast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at last come to my own home again?
Then Penelope began talking to him and said:
" Penelope then spoke to him. "

Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches and made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid them, the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest, leaving the bed chamber woman Eurynome to show Ulysses and Penelope to bed by torch light.
When Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking with one another.
On this, Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said to Penelope," Wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles, you, here, in lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from getting home though I was longing all the time to do so.
" "Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes," replied the ghost of Agamemnon," you are indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare excellence of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as Penelope the daughter of Icarius.
But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return, or shall we send some one to tell her?" "Old man," answered Ulysses," she knows already, so you need not trouble about that.
