_Chapter Fourteen.--Art and Morality._ PLATO.
Plato, with his fine aesthetic sense, would have been grateful to anyone who could have shown him how to place art, which he loved and practised so supremely himself, among the lofty activities of the spirit.
The tendency among those who followed Plato in time was to find some means of retaining art and of depriving it of the baleful influence which it was believed to exercise.
Thus was Plato (he said) in error, when he despised the arts for imitating nature, for nature herself imitates the idea, and art also seeks her inspiration directly from those ideas whence nature proceeds.
He says that Plato condemned the art of his time, because it was realistic and naturalistic: like all antique art, it exhibited a _finite_ character.
Our memories conjure up Plato, who also loved art well, and yet found himself logically obliged to banish the poet from his ideal Republic, after crowning him with roses.

There exist, moreover, altogether independently of these considerations, very weighty reasons for the belief, that, even had Plato attempted a complete theory of Poetry and the Fine Arts, it would have been far from a satisfactory one.
In this dialogue, therefore, if anywhere in Plato, we may expect to find the great lines of a theory of beauty, the grand fundamental substruction, at least, on which a palace of the critical art misht be raised; and that these substructions actually do stand out in this work with unmistakeable decision, we shall now show.

Having thus seen the finest works, estimated by the Greeks themselves as their finest, and finding all the enthusiasm of Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, ON PAINTING.
Plato joins the True and the Good in his idea of the beautiful, and all the Greeks, to whom beauty was the breath of life, regarded it as only another name for excellence of every kind.
Ã†schylus might be selected to illustrate the artistic psychology of Plato.
THE GENIUS OF GREEK ART.
All this is in perfect concord with the Greek conception of art, the sculpturesque ideal.
