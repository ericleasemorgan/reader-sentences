Reader Sentences
==================

tl;dnr  This suite of software is akin to a back-of-the-book index but on steroids.


Introduction
------------

This directory contains a suite of software used to index and then search databases of sentences, and its purpose is to faciliate a question/answer interface to Distant Reader study carrels. For example, you could ask the system "Who killed Hector?" and get back the answer "Achilles". Alternatively, you could ask the system "What is knowledge?", and get back something like this:

Very important! This system is not intended nor expected to return the answers to given questions. Instead it is intended to return plausible answers, and you are expected to use the results as discussion points or to use traditional reading techniques for the purpose of verification.

Think of this system as a tool to suppliment your reading. Create a collection of texts, index (model) the collection, search the index, interact with the model, and in the end, garner a better understanding of the collection. Think of the whole process as a sort of interactive discussion with a book. As such, this system implemements a form of reading.
